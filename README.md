# TriviaGame

This project demonstrated the use of Vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Using these three aspects, I was able to build a  trivia game that utilizes various principles to test users about their fitness knowledge. 

Getting Started
Access the game here at https://samuelpai.github.io/TriviaGame/ . Once directed to the URL, wait for the page to load and then click start. You will have 120 seconds (2 minutes) to answer all 8 questions. Once completed, or if time runs out, you will be directed to the end page where you will see the correct answers as well as your score that includes the number of questions you got right or wrong, and also the number of questions you did not answer. For more questions please email the author SamuelPai16@gmail.com for further questions.
